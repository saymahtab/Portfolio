    content: `React Hooks like useState and useEffect can be confusing at first. In this post, I break them down with real examples and explain how they make your components cleaner.

The useState hook lets you add state to functional components without converting them into classes. You just call useState with an initial value, and it returns an array with the current state and a function to update it.

useEffect, on the other hand, is for handling side effects. Think of things like fetching data, setting up event listeners, or manually updating the DOM.

Example:
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted");
  return () => console.log("Component unmounted");
}, []);

This runs only once, like componentDidMount in class components.

I’ve used these hooks in multiple projects, and once you understand them, your code becomes way more readable and manageable.`

- ESLint: For linting JS
- GitLens: For better Git history
- Live Server: For live preview

Theme: I use "One Dark Pro" because it's clean and easy on the eyes.

Settings:
I always enable auto save, format on save, and set up custom keybindings for common actions. VS Code can be a productivity machine once it's customized to your workflow.

Don’t forget to sync your settings so you can keep your setup across machines!`

    content: `When I started with HTML, CSS, and JS, I had no idea what React was. But over time, I realized I needed a better way to build UIs, especially when apps got complex.

My transition looked like this:
1. Mastering the DOM with JS
2. Learning about components and reusability
3. Understanding the need for state management
4. Diving into JSX, props, and hooks

I used YouTube channels like Net Ninja and freeCodeCamp. Building small projects like a Todo app or a calculator helped me practice what I learned.

Now, I build everything in React — from simple UIs to full-fledged apps. If you're still stuck in vanilla JS, React might feel hard at first, but it's totally worth it.`

In this post, I guide you through:
- Installing Node.js
- Creating your first Express server
- Setting up routes
- Sending JSON data
- Using middleware

Example code:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from backend!');
});
app.listen(3000);

With this setup, you can build APIs, connect to databases, and handle requests from your frontend. Express makes backend development beginner-friendly.`

1. git init - Start a repo
2. git add . - Stage changes
3. git commit -m "message" - Commit changes
4. git push - Push to remote
5. git pull - Pull from remote

Bonus: git status and git log help a lot in tracking changes.

Once you get used to these, working with Git becomes second nature. Version control is a must-have skill for every dev, and learning it early will save you a lot of headaches.`
