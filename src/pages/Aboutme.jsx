      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Hey, I'm Mohd Mahtab — a frontend-focused MERN stack developer with a strong passion for building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I started my journey in web development from scratch, learning HTML to React, and now advancing into backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        I've successfully completed my frontend development course and recently dived into backend development to become a complete MERN stack developer. From making weather apps and habit trackers to building full-fledged e-commerce and social media platforms — I love turning ideas into reality through code.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Currently, I’m working on a Twitter clone using the MERN stack, enhancing my skills in full-stack development and refining my problem-solving abilities. I’ve also worked with animations using Framer Motion, and built fun projects like Tik Tak To and Rock Paper Scissors with cool modern UIs.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Beyond development, I’ve had the honor of being mentored by incredible minds like Dev Sharma, Ram Bansal, and Prashant Jindal, and even attended a data science workshop at IIT Roorkee. My goal is to join a big tech company like Google or Flipkart, and I’m consistently learning DSA and sharpening my backend skills to achieve it.
      </p>
